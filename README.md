# Unstructured Final Project
Description: Hello and welcome to my final project for Unstructured Data! In this project, I plan to analyze stats of Hall of Fame Goalie, Martin Brodeur. I plan to scrape data from Hockey Reference in order to get his lifetime career playoff & regular season statistics. I plan on using this information to then create an efficiency score to observe when Brodeur was the most efficient in his career. Additionally, I hope to view the teams that he was most efficient against across his career.
