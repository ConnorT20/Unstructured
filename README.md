# Unstructured Final Project
Description: Hello and welcome to my final project for Unstructured Data! In this project, I plan to analyze the Olympic Hockey tournaments from the 2026 Milan-Cortina Games. I plan to scrape data from the official Olympic website, and then analyze the data to find insights of the games that impact the win probability of teams in the overall tournament.
